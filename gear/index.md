## Self-Hosted Services

 Self-hosting your services means you aren't paying monthly fees to rent your services from some provider who doesn't even care about what you want and only thinks of you as something to be exploited. This way you have the power to change or improve features you don't like, and you can avoid the circus of renting these services from cloud providers. - [Awesome self-hosted list of free open-source software you can run at home instead of renting from evil corporations](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted)

## Apocalypse Libraries

- ProtonVPN is my favorite **[VPN service]()**.
- **(808 gb) [Amazing Documentaries](https://www.magnetdl.com/a/amazing-documentaries/) ([Part 1, 2, 3](https://www.magnetdl.com/a/amazing-documentaries/)):** 940 documentaries on many different topics.
- **(14 gb) [The Appropriate Technology Library](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrepperFileShare/comments/fso1zu/appropriate_technology_library_1050_ebooks/):** consists of 1050 books on 29 subject areas of small scale, do-it-yourself technology. The Library was developed to be a portable source of appropriate technology information for aid and relief workers around the world. Since its inception, it has been used in dozens of countries around the world.
- **(440 gb) [The Ark (Note there is a main download and then an update)](https://archiveofsins.com/t/thread/945424):** Tens of thousands of documents explaining topics from gunsmithing to software.

- **(52gb) [The Complete Open Yale Courses](https://thehiddenbay.com/torrent/8437868/Complete_Open_Yale_Courses):** Recordings of all the courses taught at Yale.
- **(2gb) [The Library At The End Of The World](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1ORcaEFEa33RK2UZ_low0rKeJVOUZHkIN?fbclid=IwAR2B8LR6rXbx2ULJ7XQS1vNDqBlqyGLGzOd1Ai6IS2FB9gqunHzF9dCfAfA):** A lot of books about permaculture, foraging, off-grid survivalism, etc.
- () Survivor Library: hundreds of books on technologies that can be used by craftsman to build infrastructure, such as carriages, sailing vessels, and steam engines, without the need for sophisticated tools. Many similar resources teach Survival Skills to help people survive during a large-scale disaster, such as an EMP event or pandemic; however, few focus on the aftermath and building a new infrastructure to replace the one lost.
- **[Radical Racoons](https://radicalracoons.org/):** A collaborative how-to guide for building off-grid intentional communities.
- **(117 gb) [Variorum](https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/zuniqw/bibliotheca_alexandrina_a_600_gb_hoard_of_history/):** an academic book series in the humanities published by [Ashgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashgate "Ashgate"). The aim of each volume is to bring together, for the first time, a selection of articles by a leading scholar on their particular area of expertise. This allows easy access to material that may be hard to find separately because it is out of print or available only in specialist libraries. It also allows the reader to see the development of a scholar's thinking on a topic over time. There are over 1000 volumes in the series.
- **(51gb) [Wikipedia](https://www.inverse.com/input/guides/how-to-download-wikipedia-offline):** download the entire site to use offline. You will need to use the special viewer program. The linked article explains how to do it. Also download the apk to install the viewer on android.
- [Pham library](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z30-9EO6B0oEuFHYMKUzzzEO6p82-dYU) of tens of thousands of academic texts.
 
## Amateur Radio

1. [Gordon West Technician Book](https://amzn.to/3Us90Qu): This is the definitive book. You really need to read this book and memorize all the facts in order to use radio safely and correctly and to pass your test and get your license.
2. [Ham Radio Prep](https://hamradioprep.com/): Do not pay for any online quiz sites. Just do this free one over and over until you can reliably get all the questions right every time. These are the same questions that are on the actual test.
3. Get a starter radio: 
    - [Baofeng UV-5R](https://amzn.to/3UvzCA5): The classic handheld amateur radio that has both of the tech bands.
    - [Baofeng K5PLUS](https://amzn.to/48tZiml): Better screen shows more information. Has USB charging. Comes with knockoff Nagoya antenna but smaller and less powerful.
    - [Baofeng UV-5RH](https://amzn.to/40jVJxe): Comes with larger battery. Has USB charging. Same improved screen and knockoff Nagoya antenna.
    - [Honorable Mention: getting a really good handheld CB is 100% worth it](https://amzn.to/3NP7MLi). Everyone knows about them and understands them. No one needs any kind of license to use them. All truckers have them. Many older pickups have them. You're going to be able to talk to a lot more normal people on a regular basis. Hams are so snobby about using CB but more people use them so why would we not want one in case of emergency or boredom.
4. Optional Upgrades That I Use: 
    - [Real Nagoya Triband Antenna](https://amzn.to/3AjXhN1): This is the most popular and reputable high-quality antenna that works on these radios.
    - [Clip on speaker/mic](https://amzn.to/3Ce11A9): these are cool. I don't care what people say. They're just jealous.
