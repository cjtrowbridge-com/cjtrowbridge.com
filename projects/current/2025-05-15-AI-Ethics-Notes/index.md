# Ethical Artificial Intelligence
## CJ Trowbridge, Future Inifinitive, The Real Cornpop

Ethical issues in generative artificial intelligence

- The practical impossibility of any real ban or limits in a post-international-law world
- Lack of explicit consent vs fair use rights
- Derivative work vs stolen work
- Consolidation of power/ wealth
  - Epistemic Power
    - Centralized corporate/oligarch control over the social construction of truth and knowledge
    - The only truth is whatever serves capital
    - Bias and representation
      - What perspectives does a model built by {Sama, Elon, Zucc} ignore, exclude, or erase
  - Cloud Capital
    - Very large models are almost exclusively built/run by rent-seeking coprorations/oligarchs
