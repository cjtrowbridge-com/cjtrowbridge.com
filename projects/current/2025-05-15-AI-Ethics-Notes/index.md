A recorded livestream discussion on ethical issues in generative artificial intelligence featuring [CJ Trowbridge](https://www.tiktok.com/@cjtrowbridge/video/7196557889358564651), [Future Inifinitive](https://www.tiktok.com/@lizthedeveloper/video/7501793836335648046), and [The Real Cornpop](https://www.tiktok.com/@therealcornpop/video/7501717015967681823).

**My main takeaways of the topics discussed:**
- The practical impossibility of any real ban or limits in a post-international-law world
- Lack of explicit consent vs fair use rights
- Derivative work vs stolen work
- Alignment
  - Elon assumes he can force AI to act like Stephen Miller; it's more likely to act like the hundreds of thousands of administrative beurocrats who refused to go along with him.
- Consolidation of power/ wealth
  - Epistemic Power
    - Centralized corporate/oligarch control over the social construction of truth and knowledge
    - The only truth is whatever serves capital
    - Bias and representation
      - What perspectives does a model built by {Sama, Elon, Zucc} ignore, exclude, or erase
  - Cloud Capital
    - Very large models are almost exclusively built/run by rent-seeking coprorations/oligarchs
