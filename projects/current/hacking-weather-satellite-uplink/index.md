# Stationary 3D-Printed helicone Weather Satellite Uplink

| Field | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Feed type | Helicone (3D-printed) |
| Reflector type | Parabolic dish (TV/RV satellite reflector) |
| Alignment mechanism | Stationary (fixed mount after initial pointing) |

This is an uplink for connecting to the [GOES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_Operational_Environmental_Satellite) weather satellites using a 3D-printed helicone feed antenna with an integrated parabolic dish reflector and LNA. The [helical feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helical_antenna) is designed to be mounted on a fixed, stationary mount that is manually pointed at the satellite. This allows me to receive real-time weather forecasts, photography, and emergency alerts directly from space without needing an internet connection.

## The Project

I wanted to try duplicating the popular open-source Helicone project as a baseline reference to test my other ideas against.

This is the [3d model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6436342/files). 


Here is the parts list:
- [Solid-core 6mm^2 copper wire](https://amzn.to/4kmiW9O) for the helicone elements. I used 6mm^2 because it is the closest standard size to the ideal diameter for the GOES frequency.
- [SMA flange](https://amzn.to/4kmAlPT) to mount the feed to the dish and connect the LNA.
- [M8 bolts, nuts, and washers](https://amzn.to/4bGalwE) to secure the feed to the dish.
- [Assorted self-tapping M2 screws](https://amzn.to/4kv95ik)
- [Special Low Noise Amplifier (LNA)](https://amzn.to/45TIxB9) designed for the GOES satellite frequency.
- [RTL-SDR dongle](https://amzn.to/4tk5M1i) to receive the satellite signal.
- [Raspberry Pi Zero 2W](https://amzn.to/45SZN9K) to run rtl_tcp and stream data to my main computer, running [SatDump](https://github.com/SatDump/SatDump) and [goestools](https://github.com/pietern/goestools)
- [Battery pack For Raspberry Pi](https://amzn.to/4aBLXer) to power the receiver in the field. These are great.
- [Memory card For Raspberry Pi](https://amzn.to/4tk5KX8) to store the OS and software.


## Shared basics (still apply)

- Reflector details (dish type/size, mount design)
- Helicone details (model/source, dimensions, print settings/material)
- Feed support + weatherproofing method
- LNA placement + power method (bias-tee vs external)
- Coax type/length + adapters
- Receiver/software configuration (SatDump / goestools)
- Performance notes (SNR, lock reliability, seasonal drift)
